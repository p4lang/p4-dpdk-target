------- Test Case 1 -----
1. commands on bf_switchd console (console-1)
	./bf_switchd --install-dir $SDE_INSTALL --conf-file $SDE_INSTALL/share/tofinopd/PNA_metadata_dir/simple_l2l3_lpm.conf  --init-mode=cold -
-status-port 7777 --skip-hld mkt
	bfrt_python
	bfrt.enable
	from netaddr import IPAddress
        bfrt.simple_l2l3_lpm.pipe.MainControlImpl.ipv4_lpm.add_with_send(ipv4_addr=IPAddress('192.168.2.0'), ipv4_addr_p_length=24, port=3)
2. commands on new console (console-2)
	make tap interfaces up
	tcpdump -i TAP2 -XXx
3. commands on new console (console-3)
	tcpdump -i TAP3 -XXx
4. commands on scapy console (console-3)
	sendp(Ether(dst="aa:bb:cc:dd:00:00", src="9e:ba:ce:98:d9:d3")/IP(src="192.168.1.10", dst="192.168.2.0")/TCP(sport=7777, dport=8888)/Raw(load="0"*    50), iface='TAP0')	
	
5. Expected results
	As we configured match rule from bf-shell, if packet has destination ip "192.168.2.x" then match rule hit
	since packet received on TAP 0 which is configured as HOST port and as per p4 program send action execute 
	packet send on port2.
	
------- Test Case 2 -----
1. commands on bf_switchd console (console-1)
	rule configured in test case 1
2. commands on new console (console-2)
	listening on port 2
3. commands on new console (console-3)
	listening on port 3
4. commands on scapy console (console-3)
	sendp(Ether(dst="aa:bb:cc:dd:00:00", src="9e:ba:ce:98:d9:d3")/IP(src="192.168.1.10", dst="192.168.2.0")/TCP(sport=7777, dport=8888)/Raw(load="0"*    50), i1"*    50), iface='TAP1')
5. Expected results
	As we configured match rule from bf-shell, if packet has destination ip "192.168.2.x" then match rule hit
	since packet received on TAP 1 which is configured as NETWOK port and as per p4 program send action execute 
	packet send on port3.
	

----------------------- configuration and p4 programs are looks as below -------------------------
ports    configuration       direction 
 
Port0 -->  HOST_PORT     --> HOST_TO_NET
Port1 -->  NETWORK_PORT  --> NET_TO_HOST 
Port2 -->  HOST_PORT     --> HOST_TO_NET
Port3 -->  HOST_PORT     --> HOST_TO_NET   

P4-program
if(rule_match) {
	if(direction == NET_TO_HOST)
		send_on(port3)
	else
		send_on(port2)
}
